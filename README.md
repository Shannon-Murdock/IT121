Summary
This class covers the core features of JavaScript, the primary web development programming language. Students will write increasingly complex programs to exercise key web development concepts including forms validation, API requests, & animations. 

Throughout the course we will use common tools and techniques of professional web developers, such as source control, browser debuggers, and dependency management. All assignments will be turned in via github.com, a source-control system used widely in professional software development.

 

Required Materials
This course will reference JavaScript from Beginner to Professional (Packt Publishing), which  students can access free of charge online through - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/?orpq 

Students will also need the following free resources:

A modern, syntax-highlighting code editor. 
Note - Students can use a free online service such as https://replit.com/ to develop JavaScript applications on any internet enabled computer. Free accounts on replit.com are subject to usage limits.
